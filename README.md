# Vending-Machine

This project is my school individual assignment to create a GUI Vending Machine and apply Object Oreinted concepts.

## Project Description:
The main purpose of this system is to simulate a vending machine for customers to select items they are interested and then pay accordingly.
<br><br>
The programming language used to built the system is **Java with Swing Package**. Swing Package is mainly used to create Window based applications.
<br>
## Functionalities of the system:
- User can select any product display on the UI of the system.
- User can insert cash to purchase the product.
- Admin can add or delete the category of the product.
- Admin can manage the product by add, update and delete the product.

> This is a prototype of the system to simulate a vending machine, real cash cannot be insert into the system
